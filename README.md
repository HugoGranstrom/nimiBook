# nimibook

A port of [mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/index.html)
to [nim](https://nim-lang.org/),
powered by [nimib](https://pietroppeter.github.io/nimib/).

Currently a PoC with minimal functionality hacked together to support [sciNim/getting-started](https://github.com/SciNim/getting-started).
